# SwanMon

I am using this repository and project as a dev practice playground. The app is
a planner to work on projects, goals, tasks, etc.

The idea behind the name is that a swan is territorial with their stuff, so it
is a **swan** _monitoring_ the things you and your team work on.

## Goals

- Git good at Git
- SQL master
- Learn Clerk authentication
- Improve front-end efficiency
