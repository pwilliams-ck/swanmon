# SwanMon

![image](./public/images/swanmon-logo-color.png)

I am using this repository and project as a dev practice playground. The app is a
planner to work on on projects, goals, tasks, etc.

The idea behind the name is that a swan is territorial with their stuff, so it is
a **swan** _monitoring_ the things you and your team work on.

## Goals

- Git good at Git
- SQL master
- Get comfy with authentication
- Improve front-end efficiency
